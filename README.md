# Ifhi

Crossplatform terminal-based text editor with the aim of implementing some features, usually found in IDEs. Mainly for author's personal use in: code, plain text editing, studying reasons.

## Local testing

For Linux-like OSes there is a `localTestingBuilds.sh` script, which more or less repeats what GitHub Actions in this repo do: different builds for different CMake build types + additional "compressed" one (based on some tricks from [here](https://int21.de/linux4k/), also requires `git` to make and `gzip` to run).
